<p>Hello! My name is Pratibha and I am currently a freshman at UC Berkeley studying computer science
and data science. My interests include statistics, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction. </p>
<p> At Berkeley, I am a software developer for <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/">CodeBase</a>, an organization that works with high-growth startups to solve technical challenges.
I also am a site leader for <a href="https://www.berkeleyanova.org">ANova</a>, a service organization that works with underresourced middle and high schools
to teach students the fundamentals of computer science through interactive projects including game and app design.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not coding, I love dancing, running, taking naps, and reading.</p>
